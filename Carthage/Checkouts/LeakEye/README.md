LeakEye is a memory leak monitor inspired by PLeakSniffer.

## Family
This library is derived from the [GodEye](https://github.com/zixun/GodEye) project which can automatically display Log,Crash,Network,ANR,Leak,CPU,RAM,FPS,NetFlow,Folder and etc with one line of code. Just like god opened his eyes

## Book & Principle

**I has wrote a book named [《iOS监控编程》](),each chapter records the course function of the implementation details and the way to explore.sorry for english friends,this book wrote by chineses.**


## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.


## Installation

LeakEye is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
